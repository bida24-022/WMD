      <strong>About Slime World:</strong><br>
      Slime World is a bold and rising streetwear brand born in Botswana, built for hustlers, creatives, and everyday people chasing big dreams. 
      Founded by a young entrepreneur who balances school, passion, and purpose, Slime World is more than fashion — it’s a lifestyle movement rooted in quality, authenticity, and God-given purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      We specialize in custom-made T-shirts, hoodies, and pants that blend vibrant visuals with powerful messaging. Every drop is carefully crafted — from color to concept — to help you express your energy and identity loud and clear. Whether it’s our signature pieces from the Kama Fashion Show 2025 or everyday essentials, each item is made with heavy cotton and street-level credibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a single idea and a borrowed P100 to nationwide delivery and non-stop orders — we’re living proof that faith, hustle, and consistency work. Slime World stands tall for everyone who’s ever started from scratch with just a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn’t just a brand. It’s a movement.<br>
